# Askinator

This is a personal project trying to learn more frontend and how things are done on the client side. Using nextjs, cloudflare workers and d1 sqlite database.

There is no intention for me to make this usable in any form of a serious production enviroment, given it is a very personal project and had no motivation to implement actual auth solutions.
